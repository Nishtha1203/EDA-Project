# EDA-Project (Uber Data Analysis)
 EDA stands for Exploratory Data Analysis, it is basically an approach to analyzing data sets to summarize their main characteristics, often with visual methods.
 Here, I have analysed the uber data set with the help of pandas,matplotlib,seaborn libraries.
 My main Project Goals are:
 1. From which loaction maximum number uber rides are initiated?
2. Which is the most common destination?
3. What are the different reasons for which people take uber rides?
4. Find the percentage of people belonging to each category.
5. The given data belongs to which year? Is this a leap year?
6. How long(miles) do people travel in Uber?
7. Around which hours do most people take uber?
8. Around which hours do least people take uber?
9. Which day has the highest number of trips?
10. What are the number of rides each day?
